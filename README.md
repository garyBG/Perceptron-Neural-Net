# Perceptron-Neural-Net

## Description

A Perceptron-based neural net structure written from the ground up in MATLAB to compete in Kaggle competition, taking first place.
Optimized through generalized batch training, image preprocessing, and variable learning rate.
Performs at a 89% mean accuracy classification rate, equal to the top 1% of MLP classifiers.
